# Problem_Solving_Rush_Hour_puzzle
This project models and solves the Rush Hour puzzle using state-space search techniques. The objective is to free the red car by moving it to the exit while respecting vehicle constraints. The solution is implemented using Breadth-First Search (BFS) and A* with multiple heuristics, and visualized through a Pygame interface.
